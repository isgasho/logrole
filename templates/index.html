    Logrole is a faster, usable, fine-grained client for exploring your
    Twilio logs. It's pretty fast - there are hardly any dependencies and
    the main bottleneck for every request is making an API request. <a

    about what makes it fast</a>.

    <ul>
      <li>Customizable permissions for each user browsing the site - limit access to
    SMS/MMS bodies, resources older than a certain age, recordings, calls, call
    from, etc. etc.

      <li>To-the-hour, timezone aware resource search, customizable for each user.

      <li>Your Account Sid is obscured from end users at all times.

      <li>Easy site search - tab complete and search for a sid to go straight to the
      instance view for that resource.

      <li>MMS messages are always fetched over HTTPS. The default Twilio API/libraries
    hand back insecure image links, but we rewrite URLs before fetching them.
    </ul>
